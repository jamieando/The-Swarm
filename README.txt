The Swarm is an interactive media software that takes the form of two different kinds of
bees that hover over their beehives.

I used object oriented programing to allow each and every object in the same class to
communicate with each other, this then gave me the opportunity to add interaction when
the bees came to close to each other. 

The first interaction the user can implement is if the mouse button is clicked and dragged
the bees will be attracted and follow where the mouse cursor goes.

Lastly, the primary interaction experienced is the user can alter the size of an individual
bee of both types, and this also increases and decreases the separation the bees try to
maintain from each other. When each bee gets too close or bumps into another one, they change
their opacity and colour, and an animation appears to signify the interaction.

The instructions of how to use The Swarm are in the program it's self, click on TheSwarm.pde
to start the program.

Thank you, and I hope you enjoy The Swarm.
